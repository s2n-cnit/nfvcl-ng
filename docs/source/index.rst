   This project is under active development.

The Network Resource Management offered by CNIT is called NFVCL and it is an open-source software[1] devoted to network-oriented meta-orchestration, specifically designed for zeroOps and continuous automation.
The NFVCL is deploying ecosystem instances using Blueprints (Day-1). The deployment of a Blueprint can be done over a VIM and a Kubernetes cluster (some components may require to be VMs and others Containers). In detail, a network ecosystem is meant to be a complete functional network environment, such as a 5G system, an overlay system for network cybersecurity or a simple application service mesh.
Once a Blueprint instance has been deployed, the NFVCL is capable of managing Day-2 and Day-N operation, requested by the user, to the specific instance. The supported operations (Day-X) must be supported by the code of the specific Blueprint. In general, it can be said that the NFVCL is managing all the life-cycle of the Blueprint (LCM).

The installation procedure is described in the main `README <https://github.com/s2n-cnit/nfvcl-ng>`_.

The NFVCL is working through REST API calls, you can see every available API in the swagger offered by the NFVCL.
You can find the swagger at URL: http://NFVCL-IP:5002/docs

The Blueprint general description and list is available there :doc:`blueprints/blueprint`)

An example of deployment by the NFVCL can be an interconnected mix between VMs and PODs in Kubernetes as follow

Or maybe a Blueprint that creates only inter-connected Virtual Machines

Getting started
***************

In order to be able to deploy Blueprints you will need to:

#. Create the Topology information (You can find a general description here :doc:`topology/topology`, :doc:`topology/topology_creation`)

    A. Including at least 1 VIM where VMs are deployed

    B. Including at least 1 K8S clusters where Helm Charts are deployed (The cluster can be generated using the dedicated K8S blueprint that does not require a K8S Cluster to be present in the Topology)

#. Set up the VIM :doc:`topology/topology_vim`

#. Deploy the desired Blueprint from the available list :doc:`blueprints/blueprint`. You can use the dedicated Blueprint to create
   and onboard a K8S cluster (over VMs) in the Topology.

Creation of Virtual Machines

Prometheus scraping
*******************
Prometheus is used as metrics database. Once a Prometheus server as been added to the Topology, it can be used by the NFVCL:

    - The NFVCL install exporters on supported Blueprints.

    - Edit the Prometheus configuration to scrape from all the installed exporters

For more details you can go to :doc:`prometheus/prometheus`
